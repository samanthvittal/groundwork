project_list.png
----------------
1. The action button is not visible for both View and Issues. This is not visible either in light mode or dark mode
2. Clicking on issues displays the list of issues (issue_list.png). See the layout it is not consistent to the application style. Fonts are big, and not aligned. Dropdown boxes are way to big. The breadcrubs font size are big too.

--------------------
1. The Project details occupies too much space when we could move the issue list to the same position.
2. The Project details information partly is displayed on top. "GRWK" in light blue background and dark blue text. The active status could be displayed right next to "GRWK" and Visibility could be just an icon next to the Workspace name. For Private visibility, we can just display a lock icon and public with an eye icon or something that matches public space? The Created date is anyway displayed in the project list. So the project details can be completely removed.

--------------
1. The description is showing in the middle of the area. It should be at the top left.

issue_list.png
--------------
1. This is described in #2 of project_list.png
2. The headers are all centered but should be left aligned just like in the project_list.png with the same font size and style.
